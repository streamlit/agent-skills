# Developing with Streamlit

A collection of skills for building production-grade Streamlit apps. Each skill focuses on a specific aspect of Streamlit development.

## When to activate

Activate these skills when:
- Creating new Streamlit apps from scratch
- Adding features to existing apps
- Debugging performance issues
- Improving app design and UX
- Setting up project structure and environments
- Connecting to data sources like Snowflake

## Quick routing

**Performance issues or slow apps?** → `optimizing-streamlit-performance`

**Building a new UI?** → `choosing-streamlit-selection-widgets` + `using-streamlit-layouts`

**Building a dashboard?** → `building-streamlit-dashboards` + `displaying-streamlit-data`

**Making it look good?** → `improving-streamlit-design`

**Multi-page architecture?** → `building-streamlit-multipage-apps`

**Customizing appearance?** → `customizing-streamlit-theme`

**Setting up a project?** → `setting-up-streamlit-environment`

**App getting complex?** → `organizing-streamlit-code`

**Connecting to Snowflake?** → `connecting-streamlit-to-snowflake`

**Building a chatbot or AI assistant?** → `building-streamlit-chat-ui`

**Need features not in core Streamlit?** → `using-streamlit-custom-components`
